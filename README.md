# 🎮 Memory Game – Fractions Edition

A simple **web-based memory game** where the goal is to match pairs of cards.  
But with a twist: the cards show **fractions**, and you need to find pairs that represent the **same value** (e.g., `1/2` = `2/4`).  

This project was created as part of a **school project** on game development.
